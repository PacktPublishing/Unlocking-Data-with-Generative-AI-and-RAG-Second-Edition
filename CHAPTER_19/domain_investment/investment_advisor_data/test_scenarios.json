A ratio of 0.85 means you're getting decent returns relative to your risk.

Before making any big moves though, let's consider a few things: Historical data shows that investors who sell during downturns often lock in losses and miss the recovery. What's your timeline for needing this money? If it's more than 5 years, you likely have time to recover. Would you like to discuss adjusting your risk level instead of selling everything?"
