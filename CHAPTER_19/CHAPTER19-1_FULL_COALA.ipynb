      "🧪 Test Response: Given your age of 35 and moderate risk tolerance, a balanced approach to rebalancing your portfolio is ideal to support growth while managing risk. Here’s a specific, actionable strategy to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Assess Your Current Asset Allocation\n",
      "- Review your current portfolio breakdown across asset classes: equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), cash, and any alternative investments.\n",
      "- Identify any significant deviations from your target allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Define Your Target Allocation\n",
      "For a 35-year-old with moderate risk tolerance, a commonly recommended allocation is:\n",
      "- **60% equities** (to capture growth potential)\n",
      "- **35% fixed income** (to provide stability and income)\n",
      "- **5% cash or cash equivalents** (for liquidity and opportunities)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can adjust slightly based on your preferences, but this is a solid baseline.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Select Investments Within Each Asset Class\n",
      "- **Equities:** Diversify across U.S. large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and international stocks. Consider low-cost index funds or ETFs such as:\n",
      "  - S&P 500 ETF (e.g., VOO, SPY)\n",
      "  - Total International Stock ETF (e.g., VXUS)\n",
      "  - Small-cap ETF (e.g., VB)\n",
      "- **Fixed Income:** Use a mix of government and corporate bond funds with intermediate duration to balance yield and interest rate risk. Examples:\n",
      "  - Total Bond Market ETF (e.g., BND)\n",
      "  - Short-term bond funds for stability\n",
      "- **Cash:** Keep in a high-yield savings account or money market fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Rebalance Your Portfolio\n",
      "- Calculate the current value of each asset class.\n",
      "- Buy or sell assets to bring each category back to your target percentages.\n",
      "- Consider tax implications; use tax-advantaged accounts first for rebalancing trades.\n",
      "- If you have new contributions, direct them to underweighted asset classes to minimize transaction costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Set a Rebalancing Schedule\n",
      "- Rebalance at least annually or when any asset class deviates by more than 5% from its target allocation.\n",
      "- Automate this process if your brokerage allows.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Tips:\n",
      "- Review your risk tolerance and goals annually or after major life changes.\n",
      "- Keep an emergency fund separate from your investment portfolio.\n",
      "- Avoid emotional decisions during market volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, I can help you analyze your current holdings and create a detailed rebalancing plan tailored to your exact portfolio. Would you like to proceed with that?\n"
