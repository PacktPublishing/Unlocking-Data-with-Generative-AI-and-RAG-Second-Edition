How does Google aim to replenish more freshwater than it consumes each year as part of its focus on responsible water use?,"['In addition to focusing on responsible water use within our \noperations, we aim to replenish 20% more freshwater than we consume each year, on a global average basis. We’ll focus our replenishment efforts in watersheds that Google offices and data centers rely on. The additional volume of water we replenish at each location will vary depending on the local conditions, and we’ll prioritize replenishment projects in water-scarce regions to help ensure that we’re positively impacting the areas that need it most.\nAs of the end of 2022, the first full year since we launched \nthis strategy and target, our contracted watershed projects have replenished 271 million gallons of water\n\u2009102—\nequivalent to more than 400 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This represents 6% of our 2022 freshwater consumption. As of the end of 2022, we estimate that these 38 replenishment projects had the capacity to replenish over 1.3 billion gallons of water annually once fully implemented.Water replenishment \nprojects'
