The models were less sophisticated and more uncertain than they are today, but the implications were already worrying. Thirty years later much has changed.

What Google do for renewable energy?,"['I worked on Search for 20 years, leading the product for \nmany of those, and learned a lot about the unique impact Google can have on the world. I’ve always been proud of Google’s leadership in pushing the boundaries of sustainability in our data centers, including achieving carbon neutrality in 2007 (at the time, such accomplishments were uncommon).

The path to get to these goals is difficult, and we’re committed to working through the challenges we face with the ultimate aim of driving larger systems change to create a more sustainable future. Further, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is difficult.

How Google help with climate info and action?,"['Beyond our own footprint, Google’s founding mission—\n“Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”—can play a very important role in accelerating progress in climate information and action. A sustainable future will be built upon billions of decisions made by governments, organizations, and individuals, which will need to be grounded in good information. Increasingly, we see through Google Trends that more and more people are looking for ways to live sustainably.
