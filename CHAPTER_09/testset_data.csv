How has Google demonstrated leadership in sustainability within its data centers?,"['I worked on Search for 20 years, leading the product for \nmany of those, and learned a lot about the unique impact Google can have on the world. I’ve always been proud of Google’s leadership in pushing the boundaries of sustainability in our data centers, including achieving carbon neutrality in 2007 (at the time, such accomplishments were uncommon).

The path to get to these goals is difficult, and we’re committed to working through the challenges we face with the ultimate aim of driving larger systems change to create a more sustainable future. Further, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is difficult. Despite this, we remain focused on developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient while leveraging the opportunities that AI presents to have a positive environmental impact. \nBeyond our own footprint, Google’s founding mission—']","The aim of driving larger systems change is to create a more sustainable future by achieving net-zero emissions across all operations and value chain, running on 24/7 carbon-free energy, and developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient for a positive environmental impact.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
What role can Google Trends play in accelerating progress in climate information and action?,"['Beyond our own footprint, Google’s founding mission—\n“Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”—can play a very important role in accelerating progress in climate information and action. A sustainable future will be built upon billions of decisions made by governments, organizations, and individuals, which will need to be grounded in good information. Increasingly, we see through Google Trends that more and more people are looking for ways to live sustainably.
